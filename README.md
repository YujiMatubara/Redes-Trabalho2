# Running the project

There's a simple Makefile tested in Ubuntu (Debian-based systems with g++ probably will work). To make all files, run `make all`.

To clean the folder, run `make clean`

The executable that needs to be run is the `Simulation` ELF file. Just run `./Simulation`

# Explaining files

The `Sender.cpp` and `Sender.hpp` implement  the functionalities related to the person sending the message.

The `Receiver.cpp` and `Receiver.hpp` implement the functionalities related to the person receiving the message.

The Data Link Layer and a simple Application Layer are simulated here.

Also, there a `CommunicationPath.cpp` file that simulates a real physical layer, with bit lost and interference.
